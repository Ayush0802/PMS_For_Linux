# PMS_For_Linux
Designed a Process Monitoring System (PMS) for Linux Operating System. Using C++ I created a module which dynamically updates the status of the process and stores in the output files every 5 seconds. Using Python I created a python's Tkinter GUI to display the status of the process in the system whether it is in running,sleeping,waiting or unknown state similar to a Task manager window.

We can also check the certain attributes of the process like memory occupied, time taken by the cpu and the priority of the process.

## Monitoring processes is important for: 
- Understanding resource usage 
- Debugging performance issues 
- Identifying malicious processes
