# PMS_For_Linux
Designed a simple Process Monitoring System (PMS) for Linux Operating System. First using C++ by dynamically updating the the output files visible every 5 seconds. Second using python where I created a python's Tkinter GUI to display similar to a Task manager window.


## Monitoring processes is important for: 
- Understanding resource usage 
- Debugging performance issues 
- Identifying malicious processes
